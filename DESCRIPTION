Description: The 'StreamSurvMA' package provides an implementation of
    the cumulative estimating equation model averaging method (CEE),
    and the cumulative updated estimating equation model averaging method (CUEE),
    the renewable model averaging (Renew) method and its extension (ERenew)
    for survival analysis of stream data. The package includes a function 
    that allows users to perform survival prediction for individual observations
    under stream datasets. The function utilizes an online-updating mechanism to 
    dynamically adjust the weights of different submodels, ensuring that 
    the predictions are adaptive to the evolving data stream. The running time
    of the process is also calculated, providing users with insights into 
    the computational efficiency of the method.
    Additionally, the function enables users to obtain the parameter estimators
    of each nested submodel, which are used in the averaging process. 
    With 'StreamSurvMA', researchers and practitioners can efficiently 
    analyze survival data in a streaming fashion, enabling real-time predictions
    and decision-making in applications such as healthcare, insurance,
    and risk management.
